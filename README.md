## Running it yourself

I plan to publish the app once I finish work on the 1.0 version. 

Until then you can clone the repo and build the project in Xcode.

## Contribution

Any help you can offer with this project is most appreciated.
**However, before you start please read the COPYRIGHT\LICENSE.md file inside this repository.** 
Although all the source code of Timely is available under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, the assets are not redistributable.

If you’d like to help, here are some suggestions:
- Just try running the app and let me know if you hit any problems.
- If you spot any redundant code, or code that repeats itself that can sensible be refactored not to repeat, you’re welcome to clean it up.
- Write new tests. It doesn’t matter how small they might seem, tests are always appreciated and won’t require you to modify any of the core code.
- If you find any bugs and can fix them, by all means do.
- Right now the app is available only in English. If you could help with localization, that would be amazing!
- I postponed any work on theming, or a dark mode - as I am expecting some official API support at this WWDC.
