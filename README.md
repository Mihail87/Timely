#### Easily find the most popular stories which you missed since your last visit. 
#### So what's the secret sauce? The stories you scroll through are marked as seen. The ones you open, as read. So the SmartFeed will only show you new stories, ordered by popularity. 


## Running it yourself

The app will be published once milestone v1.0 is reached. 

Until then you can clone the repo and build the project in Xcode (use the .xcworkspace file - or simply enter xed in Terminal).

## Contribution

Any help you can offer with this project is most appreciated.
**However, before you start please read the COPYRIGHT\LICENSE.md file inside this repository.** 
Although all the source code of Timely is available under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0, the assets are not redistributable.

If you’d like to help, here are some suggestions:
- Just run the app and let me know if you hit any problems.
- If you spot redundant code, you could lend a hand in refactoring it.
- Write new tests. Tests are always a great contribution and a great place to start.
- If you find any bugs and can fix them, by all means do.
- Right now the app is available only in English. If you could help with localization, that would be a great contribution.
- I postponed any work on theming, or a dark mode - as I am expecting some official API support at this WWDC. 
- Feature ideas are great and all, problem is, I already have dozens of them queued up :)
